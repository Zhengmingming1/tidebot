# tidebot backlog

One small round a day: what shipped, what we learned (and from which project),
and ideas for later. Releases are cut weekly; these entries feed the notes.

## 2026-10-19

**Done**

- **Runs left over by a crash are closed on the next start.** If the core died mid-run
  (crash, force quit, laptop out of battery, OS restart), the run stayed "running"
  forever: Home showed it as live, the tray counted it, and with the default overlap
  policy `skip` the task never fired again. Now the core closes those rows as
  `canceled` with a stable `interrupted:` message before the scheduler starts, and sends
  one "运行中断 / Run interrupted" notice per run (at most 5). These go through the same
  rules as failures, so a "run failed" email rule covers them too. Run detail shows the
  reason in the viewer's language (`internal/app/recover.go`,
  `Store.RecoverInterruptedRuns`).
- **One core per IPC path on macOS/Linux.** `ipc.Listen` used to delete the socket
  file without checking it, so starting agentd while the desktop app was running
  quietly took over the socket and two schedulers shared one database. Now it dials
  first: a socket that answers is refused with `ipc.ErrInUse`, and a stale one is
  replaced. Windows already got this from the first-instance named pipe. Hitting
  `ErrInUse` no longer counts as a failed start for the self-update rollback.
- **Relative times stay true.** "5 分钟前" used to freeze when you left a page open.
  Now there's one shared 30s ticker (paused while the window is hidden), and hovering a
  relative time shows the full local date and time zone. This covers task detail,
  triggers, the amendment thread, optimizer proposals and the version tree.
- **Tab title shows the page and live state:** `▶ 2 个运行中 · 任务 – tidebot`, `⚠` when
  Claude Code or the provider needs a look, and the item name on detail pages.
- Wording: task status "active" is now **已启用** instead of 运行中, which looked the
  same as the run status "running" in the same table.

**Learned**

- n8n handles the same failure at startup: `packages/cli/src/eventbus/message-event-bus/message-event-bus.ts`
  (`performStartupRecovery`) collects unfinished executions and calls
  `ExecutionCrashService.markAsCrashed(ids, 'startup-recovery')`
  (`packages/cli/src/executions/execution-crash.service.ts`). The repository
  (`packages/@n8n/db/src/repositories/execution.repository.ts`) guards the transition
  on status and announces each crashed execution. tidebot does the same with a status
  guard in the UPDATE and a per-run notice. It reuses `canceled` rather than adding a
  new status, so stats, filters and the rerun button work unchanged.
- n8n `packages/frontend/@n8n/composables/src/useDocumentTitle.ts`: status prefix
  (🔄 / ⚠️ / ▶️) + name + product. That's the shape we used for the tab title.
- Open WebUI `src/lib/components/workspace/Skills.svelte`: `dayjs().fromNow()` inside a
  `Tooltip` whose content is the full `LLLL` date. Open WebUI doesn't refresh the text
  afterwards; we added the shared ticker.
- Restarting the demo with `scripts/demo-webui.sh` + kill reproduces the orphaned run.
  A rerun of the audit is a quick way to catch this class of bug.

**Ideas for later**

1. Save partial token usage during a run (every N requests) so interrupted runs still
   count toward spend and budgets. Right now they record $0.
2. Optional "rerun interrupted scheduled runs on start" per task (Cronicle/n8n-style
   recovery), off by default because runs aren't guaranteed idempotent.
3. Graceful quit: on desktop Quit / SIGTERM, wait a few seconds for running runs to
   write their final state before closing the database.
4. Favicon badge (dot) for failures/needs-confirmation, alongside the title prefix.
5. Refresh README screenshots (the task status pill now reads 已启用) at the Friday
   release.
